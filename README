acts_as_comic_engine

This is designed to be a comic engine that works with amazon s3 filehosting and support for a password protected admin panel for page uploads.
The intent is to provide a straightforward way to run webcomics off Ruby on Rails.  

Up to now I've run a custom them on a Wordpress based site with PHP.  The natural extension for me is to develop a Rails equivalent of my existing project.
